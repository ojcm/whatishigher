# To Do
With more time I would improve this app in the following ways (in no particular order):
- Get a constant image size to improve layout.
- Obfuscate the answers in the HTML. I started this (see `markCorrectHash` in `flash_app.py`) and thought it would be an opportunity to use a hash function but didnâ€™t have time to finish it.
- Implement a running total of correct answers. And then a leaderboard.
- Better layout on small devices (mobile).
- Improve button styling (bootstrap/semantic ui?).
